rsqg - The recursive sbopkg queue file generator

A script to generate the sbokpg queue file for an arbitrary number of
arguments. The queue files are placed in $HOME/.rsqg and the user may opt to
move them to sbopkg directory manually.

Queue files that are found under the $HOME/.rsqg files will not be overwittern
and they will be assumed.

Recursive queue files are important to users who want to upgrade their packages
to determine the other applications that may be affected. Also recursive queue
files are important when removing packages. Recursive queue files are generated
by means of the @ prefix to the applications.

For example:

  $ rsqg.sh letsencrypt

would generate these files:

  $ ls $HOME/.rsqg/ | cat
  augeas.sqf
  cffi.sqf
  configobj.sqf
  cryptography.sqf
  enum34.sqf
  idna.sqf
  ipaddress.sqf
  letsencrypt.sqf
  mock.sqf
  ndg_httpsclient.sqf
  psutil.sqf
  pyOpenSSL.sqf
  pyasn1.sqf
  pycparser.sqf
  pyparsing.sqf
  pyrfc3339.sqf
  python-augeas.sqf
  python-configargparse.sqf
  python-future.sqf
  python-parsedatetime.sqf

  python2-pythondialog.sqf
  pytz.sqf
  six.sqf
  werkzeug.sqf
  zope.component.sqf
  zope.event.sqf
